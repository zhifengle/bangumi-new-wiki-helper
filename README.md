# Bangumi New Wiki Helper

## Usage

First, you need to change into the example subdirectory and install all
[NodeJS][nodejs] dependencies with [npm](http://npmjs.com/) or
[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):

    npm install

Start the continuous build process to transpile the code into something that
can run in Firefox or Chrome:

    npm run build

This creates a WebExtension in the `extension` subdirectory.
Any time you edit a file, it will be rebuilt automatically.

In another shell window, run the extension in Firefox using a wrapper
around [web-ext][web-ext]:

    npm start

Any time you edit a file, [web-ext][web-ext] will reload the extension
in Firefox. To see the popup, click the watermelon icon from the browser bar.
Here is what it looks like:
